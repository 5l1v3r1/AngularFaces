  <h1>Datatables: server side rendering or client side widgets?</h1>
  <p>No matter how great a framework AngularFaces may be, it has to fit into existing
  infrastructures. Of cource, the best way to get familiar with AngularFaces is the green field scenario.
  Start with a fresh and empty project, and you'll be able to get the most out of your new tool.</p>
  <p>However, I think many developers already have a lot of code, and they just want to add
  AngularFaces to their toolbox. That why I started to write AngularFaces in the first place: I wanted
  to solve a problem that was simple on the client and very difficult on the client side. I didn't want
  to rewrite the entire application, I just wanted to add a few features to an existing application.</p>
  <h3>Embedding a PrimeFaces datatable in an AngularFaces application</h3>
  <p>
  One of the finest pieces of art in the JSF world is the PrimeFaces datatable. The good news is it is 
  compatible to AngularFaces. PrimeFaces uses optimized requests to update the table when it is sorted,
  when you enter a filter criterium or when you browse to another page of the paginator.</p>
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;prime:dataTable value="#{carPool.carPool}" var="car" paginator="true" rows="10"> 
    &lt;prime:column headerText="brand">#{car.brand}&lt;/prime:column>
    &lt;prime:column headerText="type"> #{car.type}&lt;/prime:column>
    &lt;prime:column headerText="year"> #{car.year}&lt;/prime:column>
    &lt;prime:column headerText="color">#{car.color}&lt;/prime:column>
&lt;/prime:dataTable></pre>
  </p>
  <h3>ngTable - a client side alternative</h3>
    <p>The bad news it the PrimeFaces datatable doesn't benefit much from AngularFaces
    (apart from the automatic translation to foreign languages, of course). I haven't figuered out yet how to use AngularJS
    in a table row or in a table cell.</p> 
   <p>
   On the long run it's better to use an AngularJS table. There are many table widgets. A particularly powerful 
   table widget is <a target="#" href="http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/">ngTable</a> by Vitalii Savchuk.</p>
   <p>The nice thing about AngularJS is it enable client side widgets that are every bit as simple as server side widgets. 
   Using ngTable, table including paginators, filters, sort buttons and even a CSV (aka Excel) export looks like so:</p>
<pre>
&lt;table ng-table="tableParams" value="{{carPool.carPool}}" export-csv="csv" show-filter="true"
  class="table ng-table-responsive">
  &lt;tr ng-repeat="car in $data">
    &lt;td data-title="'Brand'" sortable="'brand'" filter="{ 'brand': 'watermark' }">{{car.brand}}&lt;/td>
    &lt;td data-title="'Type'" sortable="'type'" filter="{ 'type': 'watermark' }">{{car.type}}&lt;/td>
    &lt;td data-title="'Year'" sortable="'year'" filter="{ 'year': 'number' }">{{car.year}}&lt;/td>
    &lt;td data-title="'Color'" sortable="'color'" filter="{ 'color': 'watermark' }">{{car.color}}&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
&lt;/table></pre>   
<p>The advantage of using ngTable is it's controlled by AngularJS. Every feature of AngularJS is available to you. For instance,
the values of the cells are taken from the AngularJS scope. You can set watches on them, use directives to
add validation constraints and much more.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, ngTable requires some support of the controller to do its magic. Future versions of AngularFaces will
address this problem and reduce the amount of boiler plate code required to do common tasks. 
   </p>
   <pre class="Javascript">
var app = angular.module('CarShop', ["angularfaces", 'ngTable', 'ngTableExport']).
controller('CarShopController', function($scope, $filter, ngTableParams) {
    // This initializes the Angular Model with the values of the JSF bean attributes
    initJSFScope($scope);

    $scope.tableParams = new ngTableParams({
        page: 1,                  // show first page
        count: 10,                // count per page
        sorting: { brand: 'asc' } // initial sorting
    }, {
        total: $scope.carPool.carPool.length, // length of data
        getData: function($defer, params) {
            params.settings().counts=[5, 10, 'all']; // todo: that's a hack!
            var rows = $scope.carPool.carPool;
            if (params.filter()) rows=$filter('filter')(rows, params.filter());
            if (params.sorting()) rows = $filter('orderBy')(rows, params.orderBy());
            var page = params.page();
            var pageLength = params.count();
            if (pageLength=='all') 
                $defer.resolve(rows);
            else
                $defer.resolve(rows.slice((page - 1) * pageLength, page * pageLength));
        }
    });
})</pre>
