        <div>
          <h1>Automatic pass-through attributes</h1>
          <p>AngularFaces allows you to use native AngularJS directives without having to define them as JSF pass-through attributes.
          In other words, you write the XHTML code just as if it was an ordinary AngularJS page. You don't have to use
          the new pass-through attributes of JSF 2.2. For instance, you can use ng-show or ng-hide to hide a panel group:</p>
          <pre class="xml">
&lt;h:panelGroup ng-show="false">
   ...
&lt;/h:panelGroup>
&lt;h:panelGroup ng-hide="true">
   ...
&lt;/h:panelGroup>
          </pre>
          
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          



        </div>
