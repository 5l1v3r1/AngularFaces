	<h1>Why does AngularFaces use yet another EL syntax?</h1>
	<p>AngularFaces makes a distinction between JSF attributes
		remaining on the server and attributes that are synchronized with the
		AngularJS scope:</p>
	<pre class="xml">
&lt;h:inputText value="&#123;&#123;carBean.brand}}" />
&lt;h:inputText value="#{carBean.color}" /></pre>
	<p>The brand of the car is part of the AngularJS scope, while the
		color is dealt with exclusively on the server.</p>
	<p>Originally, I had the idea to simply put every JSF bean
		attribute into the AngularJS scope. This didn't work out because I ran into
		technical problems, so I replaced the JSF syntax #&#123;...} by an
		Angular-style syntax &#123; &#123;...}}.</p>
	<p>In the mean time I've learned how to overcome the technical
		problems, but I've become fond of the syntax. First, they give you
		better control over which attributes are sent to the client. Second,
		AngularJS itself uses &#123; &#123;...}}, so the mustache syntax fits
		in nicely. After all, the general idea is to make JSF views look like
		ordinary HTML/AngularJS pages.</p>
