        <b>I'm using &lt;div ng-controller="myController"&gt;, but AngularJS doesn't get initialized properly.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In JSF ordinary HTML tag such as a div isn't part of the JSF component tree. So you've found the blind spot
        of AngularFaces 2.0: it can't perform it's magic because simply doesn't see the div. A future version of
        AngularFaces will fix this. Until then, replace the &lt;div&gt; by an &lt;h:panel layout="block"
        ng-controller="myController"&gt;. The HTML code is identical, but this this AngularFaces can add the code needed
        to run AngularJS.</p>
        <p>But since there's  a second bug, that still doesn't do the trick. You have to use both:</p>
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;h:body id="angular" style="padding-left:10px">
  &lt;form id="myForm" style="width: 700px">
    &lt;h:panelGroup ng-app="CarDealer" ng-controller="CarDealerController" angularJSFile="index.js">
      &lt;div ng-app="CarDealer" ng-controller="CarDealerController">
  </pre>
  <p>Of course, that's a work-around that will break in AngularFaces 2.1, which fixes both bugs.</p></li>

        <b>Angular shows me an error message containing the sentence "Module 'angularfaces' is not available!"
          (among many other things).</b>

        Most likely you're using a plain HTML element to activate the ng-controller (see previous question). Replace it by 
        replace the &lt;div&gt; by an &lt;h:panel layout="block"
        ng-controller="myController"&gt;, as described above. Also see the hints <a
