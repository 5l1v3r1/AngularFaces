          <h1>Automatic translation to foreign languages</h1>
          <p>AngularFaces 2.0 has been designed with foreign language support in mind. JSF always included support for internationalization,
          but it requires a lot of boilerplate code.</p>
          <p>Let's return to the car shop customer form:</p>
          <pre class="xml">
&lt;prime:panel header="Contact information">
  &lt;prime:panelGrid columns="3">
    &lt;prime:inputText value="#{customer.lastName}" />
    &lt;prime:inputText value="#{customer.firstName}" />
    &lt;prime:inputText value="#{customer.dateOfBirth}" />
    &lt;prime:inputText value="#{customer.emailAddress}" />
    &lt;prime:selectBooleanCheckbox value="#{customer.IAgreeToTheTermsAndConditions}" />
  &lt;/prime:panelGrid>
  &lt;prime:commandButton value="save" update="angular" action="#{customer.save}" />
&lt;/prime:panel>
          </pre>
          <p>This translates to a nice English version. Well, usually there are a few glitches which can be ignored 
          while your project is in its prototype phase. By the way, you can cure the glitches by providing an
          English language file. Be that as it may, we chose the bean attribute name with de-camel-casing in mind,
          so our JSF view renders correct English labels:</p>
          <img src="tutorial/step_02/carshop_english.png">
          <p>To expand to international markets, you'll have to provide translations to the texts. AngularFaces makes it very easy to do so.</p>
          
          <h3>Preparing your project</h3>
          <p>First you have to add the list of supported languages to the faces-config.xml. That's just the same procedure as in traditional JSF programming:</p>
          <pre class="xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
&lt;faces-config xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd"
  version="2.0">
  &lt;application>
    &lt;locale-config>
      &lt;default-locale>en&lt;/default-locale>
      &lt;supported-locale>de&lt;/supported-locale>
      &lt;supported-locale>es&lt;/supported-locale>
    &lt;/locale-config>
  &lt;/application>
&lt;/faces-config>          
</pre>
          <p>The next step is to define the language files. It's also the last step :).</p>
          <p>The language files resemble the standard JSF language files. They are property files that have to be in the root folder
          of your classpath. AngularFaces uses a fixed name: it's always "i18n.properties". You can configure that differently (which is good,
          because you don't have to configure it in the first place).</p>
          <p>More precisely, AngularFaces looks for the property files in the same folders JSF does:</p>
          <p>
          <ul><li>First, it looks for a file specific to your language and country, such as "i18n_de_at.properties" for Austrian German.</li>
          <li>If there's no such file matching your browser's locale settings, it looks for a file specific to your default language, such as
          "i18n_de.properties" for German (no matter which of the German speaking countries you are from).</li>
          <li>If there's still no such file, AngularFaces simply uses "i18n.properties". By default, this file is assumed to be the English version,
          although you are free to use a different language if you insist.</li>
          <li>If the "i18n.properties" file is also missing, AngularFaces displays the original text. So in most cases, there's no need to provide
          an "i18n.properties" file containing the English translation. However, you can use this file to fix the glitches caused by the
          automatic "de-camel-casing" algorithm which guesses labels from JSF bean attribute names.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The language files</h3>
          <p>The language files drop several of the constraints give by standard JSF. You can use arbitrary keys. The idea is to simply use the 
          original texts as keys. In a few cases you have to add extra attributes to get rid of ambiguous translations, but in most cases this
          approach works surprisingly good. The german translation file of our example looks like so:<p>
          <pre class="xml">
Car shop - customer contact information=Kontaktinformation
Contact information=Ihre Anschrift
last name=Nachname
first name=Vorname
date of birth=Geburtsdatum
email address=E-Mail-Adresse
i agree to the terms and conditions="Ich habe die AGBs gelesen und akzeptiert."
save=Speichern
</pre>
          <p>You may or may not surround keys and translations with double quotes. Quotes are useful if the texts contain an "equals" sign.</p>
          <h3>How to modify your JSF file to benefit from the translation files</h3>
          Now, that's the nice part of AngularFaces: you don't have to do anything to make your JSF files multiligual. Adding the language files and
          configuring the faces-config.xml is all you have to do to make the contact form look like this:<p>
          <img src="tutorial/step_02/carshop_german.png" />
          <img src="tutorial/step_02/carshop_spanish.png" />
          
          <p>Which language is rendered depends on the locale setting of the users browsers. Putting it in a nutshell, every customer of yours' will see
          the JSF page in their language.</p>
          <h3>Special cases</h3>
          <p>Currently, there are only three JSF attributes that are translated automatically:
          <ul>
          <li>value (unless it contains an JSF EL expression or an AngularJS mustache)</li>
          <li>header</li>
          <li>headerText</li>
          </ul>
          This list will grow over time, but there's a class of texts AngularFaces can't translate automatically.
          Simple texts that aren't part of a JSF component are invisible to JSF and to AngularFaces in particular.
          To solve the problem, there are two tags to force translation:
          <ul><li>&lt;translate value="Translate me!" /&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;i18n value="Me, too!" /&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          Both tags are synonyms. AngularFaces supports them both because i18n is shorter and used by
          many, many developers, but &lt;translate&gt; adds more clarity to the code.
