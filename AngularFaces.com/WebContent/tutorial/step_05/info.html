          <h1>Synchronizing arbitrary JSF attributes with the client</h1>
          <p>In the previous chapters of the tutorial you've seen how to synchronize JSF
          bean attributes with the AngularJS model. However, you aren't limited
          to input field and html attributes.</p>
          <h3>Sending JSF beans to the client</h3>
          <p>To send an arbitrary JSF bean attribute to the client simply put
          a mustache in a comment:</p>
<pre highlight class="xml">
&lt;!-- { {grid.rows}} --></pre>
          <p>The disadvantage of this approach is that the comment itself is sent to the client. It doesn't hurt,
          but it's not needed, either. So maybe it's a better idea to create an output text rendered by JSF:</p>
<pre highlight class="xml">
&lt;h:outputText value="{ {grid.rows}}" rendered="false" /></pre>
          <p>At first glance, this looks a bit weird. If works because JSF evaluates expressions even if the tag isn't rendered.</p>			
          </p>
          <h3>Complex beans</h3>
          <p>AngularFaces uses Gson to convert beans into JSon objects. Sometimes this makes for clumsy data structures.
          For instance, the playground of the AngularTetris demo is a simple two-dimensional array of integers. However,
          I had to chose a much more complicated data structure because AngularJS had difficulties to access the
          cells in two nested ng-repeat directives. I suspect I did something wrong, but I also suppose that what feels
          a natural data structure in Java doesn't always result in a simple AngularJS model.</p>
          <p>A particular nasty problem are arrays and hash maps. Because of Java's type erasure, there's no
          simple way to send a table back to the server. Everything's fine until the table grows at the client side.
          Gson doesn't know the type of the array, so it can't simply add rows to the table on the server side.
          That's the reason why I postponed two-way synchronization until AngularFaces 2.1.</p>
          
          </p>

          <h3>Sending AngularJS model values to the server</h3>
          <p>
          That's a feature left for AngularFaces 2.1. Currently, the only way to send values back to the server
          are input fields. Of course you can add an &lt;h:inputText&gt; rendered invisible by CSS. The next request 
          automatically sends values stored in the hidden field back to the server.
          </p>
          <h3>Two-way synchronizing</h3>
          <p>
          That's a feature left for AngularFaces 2.1. In the meantime the only work-around is using a
          hidden input field.
