        <div>
          <h1>Getting started</h1>
          <p>The most simple way to use AngularFaces is to simply include the jar file in your project.
          Sometimes this is all you need to do: for instance, the automatic creation of labels and messages
          works without further configuration. In most cases you should add a context parameter to the web.xml file.</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;context-param>
    &lt;param-name>javax.faces.FACELETS_DECORATORS&lt;/param-name>
    &lt;param-value>
    de.beyondjava.angularFaces.core.tagTransformer.AngularTagDecorator
 &lt;/param-value>
&lt;/context-param></pre>
          <p>If you forget the context parameter, AngularFaces reminds you. An error message is printed to the
          error log, and in developer mode a global error message is shown on every JSF page.</p>  
          </p>
          <p>AngularFaces uses AngularJS 1.2.22 and jQuery 1.11.1. In the current version there's no way to
          configure AngularFaces to load different versions of the libraries. In production mode (i. e. web.xml context
          parameter javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE set to "Production"), the minified versions are loaded. Otherwise,
          the debugger-friendly version is used.</p>
          <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
          <p>AngularFaces 2.0 currently requires Java 6 or above. As for the client side it supports Javascript and AngularJS.</p>
          <p> A future version of AngularFaces will support
          Dart and AngularDart, but I've postponed Dart support because I'm waiting for a couple of announced breaking changes in AngularDart.
          </p>
          <p>
          AngularFaces supports PrimeFaces 5.0 and above (and probably earlier version, too). 
          It doesn't really need PrimeFaces, but at the time of writing the code contains an
          accidential dependency
          to PrimeFaces that requires PrimeFaces 5.0 in the class path. A future version of AngularFaces will fix this, making PrimeFaces
          an optional (but highly welcome) library.</p>
          <p>Most of the examples are based on Maven. Some of the examples are based on Spring Boot and Gradle. Actually AngularFaces doesn't require
          any of them - Maven and Gradle are just nice tools to compile and package the jar and war files.</p>
          <h2>Brief introduction for the experts</h2>
          <p>There are two ways to use AngularFaces: use one of the precompiled distribution jars, or build it from source.<p>
          <strong>Use the precompiled jar</strong>
          <p>Currently, AngularFaces is not hosted at Maven central, so you have to use <a target="#"
           href="http://devblog.virtage.com/2013/04/my-maven-project-needs-not-yet-mavenized-jars-dos-and-donts/">this recipe</a>
           to install the pre-packaged jar to your maven repository. The jar file is hosted in the 
           <a target="#" href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/tree/master/dist">distribution folder</a> of the AngularFaces project.</p>
           <strong>Build AngularFaces from source</strong>
          <p>
          Maven and Gradle users might want to "git clone" the <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/tree/master/AngularFaces_2.0/AngularFaces-core">AngularFaces 2.0 core project</a> and run "maven install".</p>
          <strong>The pom.xml</strong>
          <p>
          After installing the jar (no matter wether you've built it from source or use the pre-packaged file),
          AngularFaces 2.0 can be used in your pom.xml like this:</p>
          <pre class="xml">
&lt;dependencies>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>de.beyondjava&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>angularFaces-core&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>2.0.0&lt;/version>
  &lt;/dependency>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>com.sun.faces&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>jsf-api&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>2.2.7&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>compile&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>com.sun.faces&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>jsf-impl&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>2.2.7&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>compile&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
&lt;/dependencies>
          </pre>
          <p>Of course you'll probably have to adjust the version number of AngularFaces. It won't remain version 2.0.0 forever :).</p>
          </p>
          <h2>Verbose explanation for the rest of us</h2>
          I've prepared a couple of tutorial projects for you. The first tutorial project doesn't do much: it's simply there to lay the ground to build on later.
          <br /><br />
          You find the first tutorial project at <a target="#" href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/tree/master/Tutorial/step_00">my GitHub repository.</a>
          I suggest you download the entire GitHub repository. Currently, AngularFaces hasn't made it to Maven Central yet. Until it does, building it from source
          is the best approach. It's a fairly simple approach, by the way.<br /><br />
          <h3>Downloading AngularFaces with Git</h3>
          GitHub is build around Git, so probably the easiest way to get started is to clone the AngularFaces repository to your local hard disk.
          In order to clone it to - say - C:\AngularFaces, proceed as follows. Open the
          command shell. In the case of Windows, you do it by hitting the keys "Windows" and "R" simulaniously, typing "CMD" and hitting the "return" key.
          Now a black window (the "command shell") opens. As for Unix users - well, I suppose you're more familiar with the shell than I am, so I'll
          omit the description. Now that the shell is open, enter these commands:
          <br />
          <pre class="bat">
C:\
md \AngularFaces
cd \AngularFaces
git clone git@github.com:stephanrauh/AngularFaces.git
          </pre>
          <p>Again, the commands are slightly different in the UNIX world, but I'd rather stick with the Windows version for the rest of the tutorial.</p>
          <h3>Downloading AngularFaces using Subversion</h3>
          <p>You can also download AngularFaces using Subversion. The corresponding URL is https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces.</p>
          <h3>Downloading AngularFaces as a ZIP file</h3>
          <p>
          Of course, you can also download the ZIP file from GitHub. The disadvantage is it's more difficult to update your project. If you don't mind,
          download <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/archive/master.zip">the master zip file</a> from GitHub. There's also a
          "Download Zip" button at <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces">https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Compile the projects using Maven</h2>
          <p>
          The next step is to import the projects into your IDE. Alternatively, you can compile the projects from the command line using Maven.<br>
          Eclipse users click "Import... --> Existing Maven Projects" and select these two projects:</p>
          <img src="tutorial/step_00/eclipseMaven.png">
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>The next step is to set up an Apache Tomcat server and to deploy the AngularFaces tutorial project. After starting Tomcat  
          open the URL <a target="#" href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/angularfaces-tutorial-step-00/index.jsf">http://127.0.0.1:8080/angularfaces-tutorial-step-00/index.jsf</a>. As mentioned above, the first tutorial page isn't
          really exciting: just a few texts and an image. I reduced the first example as much as possible because its only purpose is to
          check the installation. The only AngularFaces feature it uses is the relaxed declaration of the head and body tags:</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>AngularFaces 2.0 tutorial step 00 - Introducing AngularTetris&gt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body style="width:1000px">
    &lt;h:graphicImage library="images" name="AngularTetris.png" />
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/f:view></pre>
          <p>Beginning with JSF 2.2 you can simply write &lt;body&gt; instead of &lt;h:body&gt; - under certain circumstances. AngularFaces
          allows you to always use the short-hand version.</p>
          <h3>Project setup</h3> 
          <p> 
          This isn't as trivial as it sounds. The default project setup includes AngularFaces to your libraries - and that means AngularFaces
          starts up and tries to improve your JSF files. The first tutorial is designed in a way that AngularFaces can't improve anything,
          but you should find a few messages in the console window (or the catalina.out file).</p>
          <p>The folder angularfaces-tutorial-step-00//WEB-INF/lib of the Tomcat webapps folder should contain these libraries:</p>
          <img src="tutorial/step_00/libraries.png">
          <p>
          AngularFaces doesn't really require PrimeFaces, but it's in the folder because AngularFaces supports PrimeFaces. Gson, classmate,
          commons-beanutils, commons-logging and the two validation API jars are added by AngularFaces 2.0 core.</p> 
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
           <br />
        </div>
