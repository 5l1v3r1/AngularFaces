          <h1>What is AngularFaces?</h1>
          <p>AngularFaces simplifies many tedious tasks in JSF programming. The core features is adding AngularJS to JSF, but it doesn't stop there.<p>
           
          <p>See the <a href="http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/angularfaces-2-0-embraces-html5-primefaces/">AngularFaces 2.0 announcement</a> on BeyondJava.net. The original
          announcement <a target="#" href="http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/angularfaces-jsf-beyond-ajax/">AngularJS puts JSF on steroids</a> also covers many key
          ideas still valid with AngularFaces 2.0.</p>
          
          <h1>What is new in AngularFaces 2.0?</h1>
          <p>AngularFaces 1.0 tried to (and succeeded in) deriving JSF widgets from PrimeFaces widgets. It managed to make many popular PrimeFaces widgets Angular-aware 
          (to coin a term). However, PrimeFaces widgets aren't really designed for deriving components from. Plus, JSF 2.2 made the HTML5 style popular in the JSF world.
          Many people stopped using heavy-weight component libraries. If people consider PrimeFaces heavyweight, what's AngularFaces to them?</p>
          <p>So AngularFaces 2.0 tackles the problem from a different angle. Instead of creating new widgets it integrates into the existing widgets
          of PrimeFaces, Mojarra, MyFaces, HTML5 and probably most other JSF component libraries.</p>   

          <h1>AngularJS vs. AngularDart</h1>
          <p>A poll on <a target="#" href="http://www.beyondjava.net">beyondjava.net</a> revealed that a strong minority of you favors AngularDart over AngularJS. 
          So the first version of AngularFaces 2.0 concentrates on the Javascript community. However, I still consider Dart the superior language (and
          definitely a lot more fun, at least to me), so a future version of AngularFaces is going to support both AngularJS and AngularDart.</p> 
        
          <h1>About the tutorial</h1>
          <p>The tutorial will introduce you step-by-step to AngularFaces.</p>
          <p>The first three chapters make you familiar with a couple of feature that help you - without requiring Javascript programming. Chapter 5 covers
          a similar feature. AngularFaces reads JSR303 annotations from JSF beans and brings them to the client. </p>
          <p>AngularJS itself is covered in step 3, 4, 6 and 7.</p>
