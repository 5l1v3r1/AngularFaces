  <h1>What is AngularFaces?</h1>
  <p>AngularFaces simplifies many tedious tasks in JSF programming. The core feature is to add AngularJS to JSF, but
    it doesn't stop there. Among other things, it add labels and messages automatically to input fields, evaluates the
    Bean Annotation API attributes (e.g. @Max, @Min, @Size, @NotNull) on the client and helps you to target an
    international audience: all you have to provide the foreign language translations. AngularFaces does the rest of the
    work for you. Oh, and there's one last thing: AngularFaces modifies the AJAX engine of JSF. Native AngularFaces AJAX
    requests don't send HTML code to the client. The just send data, saving a lot of bandwidth.

    This tutorial makes you familiar with every AngularFaces feature. Additional information can be found at <a
      target="#" href="http://beyondjava.net">BeyondJava.net</a>, for instance the the <a
      href="http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/angularfaces-2-0-embraces-html5-primefaces/">AngularFaces 2.0
      announcement</a> on BeyondJava.net. The original announcement <a target="#"
      href="http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/angularfaces-jsf-beyond-ajax/">AngularJS puts JSF on steroids</a> also covers
    many key ideas still valid with AngularFaces 2.0.
  </p>

  <h1>What is new in AngularFaces 2.0?</h1>
  <p>AngularFaces 1.0 derived JSF widgets from PrimeFaces widgets. It managed to make many popular PrimeFaces
    widgets Angular-aware (for want of a better word). However, PrimeFaces widgets aren't really designed with deriving
    components in mind. Plus, JSF 2.2 made the HTML5 style popular in the JSF world. Many people stopped to use
    heavy-weight component libraries. If people consider PrimeFaces heavyweight, what's AngularFaces to them?</p>
  <p>So AngularFaces 2.0 tackles the problem from a different angle. Instead of creating new widgets it integrates
    into the existing widgets of PrimeFaces, Mojarra, MyFaces, HTML5 and probably most other JSF component libraries.</p>

  <h3>AngularJS vs. AngularDart</h3>
  <p>
    A poll on <a target="#" href="http://www.beyondjava.net">beyondjava.net</a> revealed that a strong minority of you
    favors AngularDart over AngularJS. A surprisingly strong minority, but a minority nonetheless. So the first version
    of AngularFaces 2.0 concentrates on the Javascript branch of Angular (i.e. AngularJS). However, I still consider
    Dart the superior language (and definitely a lot more fun, at least to me), so a future version of AngularFaces is
    going to support both AngularJS and AngularDart.
  </p>
  <h3>Do I have to be familiar with AngularJS to benefit from AngularFaces?</h3>
  No. AngularFaces offers a couple of nice features you can use almost without using AngularJS. Simplified foreign language
  support, Client Side Bean Validation and automatic creation of labels and messages don't require AngularJS knowledge.
  It's even possible to use AngularFaces as a way to simplify Javascript programming without knowing a lot about
  AngularJS. Maybe the only thing you should abstain from is jQuery DOM tree manipulation. AngularJS manipulates the
  DOM tree itself, so it might react confused.</p>

  <h3>About the tutorial</h3>
  <p>The tutorial will introduce you step-by-step to AngularFaces.</p>
  <p>The first three chapters make you familiar with a couple of features that help you - without requiring
    Javascript programming. Chapter 5 covers a similar feature: AngularFaces reads JSR303 annotations from JSF beans and
    brings them to the client.</p>
  <p>AngularJS itself is covered in step 3, 4, 6 and 7.</p>
