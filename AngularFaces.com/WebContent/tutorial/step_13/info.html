  <h1>How to configure AngularJS</h1>
  <p>The simplest way to get an AngularFaces application running is to add ng-controller and ng-app to the
  &lt;body&gt; tag. It's also possible to add the ng-controller to any other JSF component. The important
  bit is ordinary HTML tags don't work - in particular &lt;div&gt; doesn't. A future version of
  AngularFaces will fix it (it will allow to use at least the two most popular tags &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;).</p>
  <p>The complete set of attributes to activate AngularJS is shown in this snippet:
<pre class="xml">
&lt;h:body id="angular" 
        ng-app="CarDealer" 
        ng-controller="CarDealerController" 
        angularJSFile="filter.js">
</pre>  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's a good idea to attach the id "angular" to the &lt;body&gt; tag. In theory, it can also be at different places,
    but putting it at the root guarantees it can always be referenced without any prefixes.
    </li>
    <li>ng-app is identical to the ng-app attribute of AngularJS (it's a pass-through attribute).</li>
    <li>ng-controller is identical to the ng-controller attribute of AngularJS (it's a pass-through attribute).</li>
    <li>angularJSFile is an optional attribute to define the file containing your AngularJS controller. 
    By default, AngularFaces loads the file "main.js" in the folder of
    the JSF file.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Using ng-controller in a &lt;div&gt;</h3>
  <p>Due to a bug it's a tad difficult to use ng-controller in a div. You have to replace the &lt;div&gt; by &lt;h:panelGroup&gt;. But since there's
  a second bug, that still doesn't do the trick. You have to use both:</p>
  <pre class="xml">
&lt;h:body id="angular" style="padding-left:10px">
  &lt;form id="myForm" style="width: 700px">
    &lt;h:panelGroup ng-app="CarDealer" ng-controller="CarDealerController" angularJSFile="index.js">
      &lt;div ng-app="CarDealer" ng-controller="CarDealerController">
  </pre>
  <p>Of course, that's a work-around that will break in AngularFaces 2.1, which fixes both bugs.</p>
