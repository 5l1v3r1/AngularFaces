AngularFaces
============

This subproject is the source code of the out-dated AngularFaces documentation page, http://www.angularfaces.com. 

To learn more about AngularFaces, have a look at https://www.angularFaces.net and http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/angularfaces-jsf-beyond-ajax/.

There's also a showcase at http://showcase.angularfaces.com demonstrating the older version of AngularFaces 1.0.
