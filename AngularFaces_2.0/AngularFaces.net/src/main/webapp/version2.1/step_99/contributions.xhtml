          <p>
          There are many ways you can involve yourself in the project. It's a lot of fun, too. 
          </p>
          <p>The easiest way is to report a bug. 
		  Just open the <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/issues">AngularFaces GitHub bugtracker</a> in your browser
		  and report your problem. Or your question. Or you suggestion how to make the project better. I appreciate your feedback!
          </p>        
          <p>If you're more ambitious, you are welcome to contribute examples or to improve the tutorial and manual pages.
          They, too, are in the GitHub repository (in the subfolder <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/AngularFaces/tree/master/AngularFaces.com">AngularFaces.com</a>).
          </p>
          <p>And of course you can write components, bug fixes or other improvements yourself. The easiest way is to fork the project and to send me a pull request later.
          </p>
          <p>In any case it may be a good idea to contact me so I can make sure your ideas match my strategy. You can contact me by opening a GitHub ticket,
          by leaving a comment on <a href="http://www.beyondjava.net">my blog</a> or by sending a message on Twitter to @beyondjava.
          </p>
          <p>
          Enjoy!
