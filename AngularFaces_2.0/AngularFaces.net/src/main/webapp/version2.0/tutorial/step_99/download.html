          <h1>Download</h1>
          <p>The stable releases of AngularFaces (currently only 2.0) are available at Maven central. You can either download the jar manually
          by opening <a target="#" href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cbeyondjava">http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cbeyondjava</a>
          in your browser, or by adding the dependency to your pom.xml or gradle build file:
          </p>
          <pre class="xml">
&lt;dependency>
  &lt;groupId>de.beyondjava&lt;/groupId>
  &lt;artifactId>angularFaces-core&lt;/artifactId>
  &lt;version>2.0.0&lt;/version>
&lt;/dependency>
          </pre>
          <p>If you're the adventurous type, you can also build AngularFaces from source. But be warned: Every once in a while the head revision
          on GitHub will be broken. How to build the project from source is described in the <a href="http://angularfaces.com/index.html#/step-00.html">Bootstrapping</a>
          chapter of this tutorial.
